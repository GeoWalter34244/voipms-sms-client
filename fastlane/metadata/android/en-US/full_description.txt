VoIP.ms SMS is an Android messaging app for VoIP.ms that seeks to replicate the aesthetic of Google's official SMS app.

FEATURES

• Material design
• Push notifications (if using the Google Play version of the app)
• Synchronization with device contacts
• Message search
• Comprehensive support for synchronization with VoIP.ms
• Completely free

RATIONALE

A number of people use VoIP.ms as a cheaper alternative to subscribing to a voice plan for their mobile devices.

Unfortunately, this can make sending text messages rather difficult, as the VoIP.ms SMS Message Center is clearly built as a diagnostic tool for use in desktop browsers, not as an easy way to send and receive messages on a mobile device.

VoIP.ms does provide a mobile version of this interface with an improved UI, but it still lacks important features that are only possible with a dedicated app.

INSTALLATION

The standard version of the app uses closed-source Firebase libraries to support push notifications and facilitate crash reporting and analytics, among other purposes. A version of the application that is completely open source is available from F-Droid.

Both versions are available from the Releases section of the GitHub repository at https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/releases.

DOCUMENTATION

The app's documentation is available in the HELP.md file at https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/blob/master/HELP.md
